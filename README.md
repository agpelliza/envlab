Envirnoment for Lab
===================

This project aims to hold a collection of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbooks references to be run on a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) server in order to configure a Lab environment.
For simplicity it also holds a simple [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration file to spin up a testing sever.
